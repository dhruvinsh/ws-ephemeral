# WS-EPHEMERAL

This project aims to automate setting up ephemeral port on Windscribe VPN
service for the purpose of port forwarding. Once the setup is done it wait
patiently for next seven days. It delete the ephemeral port setting if any and
set the new one. Useful for some torrent application which are running behind
Windscribe VPN and need to open the ports.
